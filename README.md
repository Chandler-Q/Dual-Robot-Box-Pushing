# Dual-Robot-Box-Pushing
Dual-robot cooperative box-pushing system using Pololu 3pi+. Implements Asymmetric, Symmetric PID, and Phase-Based Sensor Fusion strategies. Uses bump and line sensors for real-time trajectory correction. Results show Strategy C (Sensor Fusion) achieves superior stability and accuracy over standard PID methods.
